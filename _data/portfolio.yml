  blurb: >
    GBTIS (Gesture Based Text Input System) was a capstone project written by myself, Richard Carson, and Max DeMelo.  The system uses a Microsoft Kinect to track
    a users finger-tip and interpret the users hand motions as text, allowing a user to "Write in the air".  The project was completed in fulfilment of SYSC4927 and
    earned our group an A.
