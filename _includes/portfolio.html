    <p>GBTIS (Gesture Based Text Input System) was a capstone project written by myself, Richard Carson, and Max DeMelo. The system
        uses a Microsoft Kinect to track a users finger-tip and interpret the users hand motions as text, allowing a user to
        "Write in the air". The project was completed in fulfilment of SYSC4927 and earned our group an A.
